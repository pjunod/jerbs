A Claude skill that screens your job-related emails against your personal criteria, drafts
follow-up replies, and tracks your recruiter correspondence — so you only spend time on
opportunities worth pursuing.

---

## What it does

- **Two-pass Gmail scan** — catches both job alert digests (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) and direct recruiter outreach
- **Configurable screening criteria** — salary floor, remote preference, dealbreakers, seniority, target industries, company whitelist/blacklist, and more
- **Verdict + reasoning** — each email gets a 🟢 Interested / 🟡 Maybe / 🔴 Filtered Out verdict with a one-sentence reason naming the specific criterion
- **Draft replies** — ready-to-copy reply drafts for anything worth pursuing, requesting any missing info in a single message
- **Send mode** — optionally have Claude send replies on your behalf automatically, with full logging
- **Correspondence tracking** — logs every sent reply and checks for recruiter responses on each run, surfacing active threads at the top of your report
- **Spreadsheet export** — optional `.xlsx` pipeline tracker with color-coded status dropdowns and collapsible dead-end groups
- **Auto-scheduler** — runs jerbs automatically on a variable cadence (15 min during business hours, 60 min off-hours, 5 min rapid mode after replies are sent)

**Runtime files** (not in the repo — created automatically on first run):

| Deployment | Criteria file | Correspondence log |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code (CLI) | `~/.claude/jerbs/criteria.json` | `~/.claude/jerbs/correspondence.json` |
| Local daemon | `~/.jerbs/criteria.json` | *(tracked in criteria file)* |
| Claude.ai Project | Project file (re-upload after changes) | Project file (re-upload after changes) |

---

## Deployment modes

jerbs runs in three modes. Pick the one that fits your setup.

### Claude.ai (browser)

Best for: casual use, no local setup required.

- Runs entirely in your browser via Claude's MCP connector system
- Gmail is connected via Settings → Connectors — no API keys needed
- Auto-scheduler widget runs while the tab is open
- Criteria and correspondence log are stored as project files; Claude outputs updated JSON at the end of any run where something changed, and prompts you to re-upload

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for setup steps.

### Claude Code (CLI)

Best for: power users who want zero-friction local file management.

- Runs inside the Claude Code CLI with Gmail connected via Claude.ai connectors
- Reads and writes `~/.claude/jerbs/criteria.json` and `~/.claude/jerbs/correspondence.json` directly — no re-uploading
- `/jerbs` available as a global slash command once installed (see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md))

### Local daemon

Best for: always-on background screening with no browser required.

- Standalone Python process, runs continuously in the background or as a system service
- Uses the Anthropic API directly (bring your own API key)
- Authenticates with Gmail via Google Cloud OAuth2 credentials
- Supports `--once`, `--send`, `--export` flags
- Runtime files live at `~/.jerbs/`

See [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) for full setup including Gmail API credentials and system service configuration.

## How files are managed

### Claude Code
Claude reads and writes `~/.claude/jerbs/criteria.json` and `~/.claude/jerbs/correspondence.json`
directly. Nothing extra needed — files stay in sync automatically after every run.

On first run, if no criteria file is found at the default location, Claude asks if you have
an existing file elsewhere and copies it over. The working copy is always `~/.claude/jerbs/`.

### Claude.ai Project
Claude reads both files from the project context at the start of every conversation.
Since it can't write back to project files directly, at the end of any run where something
changed, it outputs the updated JSON and prompts you to re-upload the file(s) to the project.
On clean runs with no changes, it stays quiet.

### Local daemon
The daemon reads and writes `~/.jerbs/criteria.json` directly. Pass `--criteria /path/to/file`
to use a different location.

---

## Criteria profile

Your criteria are stored in `criteria.json`. Claude (or the daemon wizard) creates and updates
this file automatically. The full schema is in `shared/criteria_template.json`.

Key sections:

| Section | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `identity` | Your name, title, target roles, seniority level |
| `target_companies` | Industries, company types, whitelist, blacklist |
| `role_requirements` | Employment type, remote preference, visa sponsorship |
| `compensation` | Base salary floor, TC target, sliding scale notes |
| `tech_stack` | Required, dealbreaker, and preferred tech |
| `hard_dealbreakers` | Automatic fail conditions |
| `required_info` | Fields to always ask about if missing (comp, equity, WFH policy, etc.) |
| `reply_settings` | Tone and signature for draft replies |
| `send_mode` | Whether Claude sends replies automatically (off by default) |

You can update any section at any time without re-doing the full wizard:

```
"Update my salary floor to $200k"
"Add Google to my dream companies"
"Add 'no unpaid take-homes' as a dealbreaker"
"Change my reply tone to brief"
"Enable send mode"
"Disable send mode"
```

---

## Send mode

By default, jerbs runs in **dry-run mode** — draft replies are shown as copy-paste text
and nothing is sent. You're always in control of what goes out.

**Send mode** allows Claude (or the daemon) to send replies on your behalf automatically.
Every sent message is logged to the correspondence log.

To enable:
```
"Enable send mode"
```

Claude will warn you and ask for confirmation before switching it on. To disable:
```
"Disable send mode"
```

The current mode is always shown prominently at the start of every screening run — it
can never be ambiguous.

---

## Correspondence tracking

All sent replies (and dry-run drafts) are logged to the correspondence log. Each entry
records the company, role, recipient, full message body, Gmail thread IDs, and whether
you're still waiting on a reply.

On every subsequent run, jerbs checks open threads for recruiter responses and surfaces
them at the top of your report:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ACTIVE THREADS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📬 Reply received
  Acme Corp — Staff Engineer
  They replied 2 hours ago. Asking for your availability next week.

⏳ Awaiting reply (3 days)
  Initech — Principal Engineer
  Reached out on Mar 25. No response yet.
```

You can also ask:
```
"Show my correspondence log"
"Clear my correspondence log"
```

---

## Spreadsheet export

After a screening run, say `"export to spreadsheet"` and Claude runs `shared/scripts/export_results.py`.

The `.xlsx` has two sheets:

- **Summary** — run date, counts by verdict, full color-coded status guide
- **Results** — one row per opportunity, sorted pass → maybe → fail, with columns for
  company, role, location, posting URL, verdict, comp assessment, and a **Status** dropdown
  tracking the full hiring pipeline from *New* through *Offer accepted* or *Rejected*

Dead-end rows (No response, Withdrew, Rejected, Filtered out) are grouped and collapsed
at the bottom — click `+` to expand.

### Requirements

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

---

## Auto-scheduler

The scheduler runs jerbs automatically without manual prompting. Ask Claude to
`"start the scheduler"` and it renders an interactive widget in the conversation.

**Cadence:**

| Mode | Interval | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Business hours | 15 min | Within your configured hours |
| Off-hours | 60 min | Outside business hours |
| Rapid response | 5 min for 30 min | Auto-triggered when draft replies are generated |

The browser scheduler (`claude-ai/assets/scheduler.html`) runs while the Claude.ai tab is
open. It is not a background service — it requires an active browser tab.

The local daemon (`claude-code/`) runs continuously as a true background process and does
not require a browser.

---

## Constraints

- **Dry-run by default** — Claude never sends, deletes, labels, or archives Gmail messages
  unless you explicitly enable send mode and confirm
- **Send mode requires double confirmation** — Claude warns you clearly before enabling
- **You always see what was sent** — in send mode, the full text of every sent reply is
  shown in the run report
- **Spreadsheet export is always optional** — never created unless you ask

---

## Contributing

### Linting

Python code is linted and formatted with [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) (covers PEP 8,
pyflakes, isort, bugbear, and pyupgrade). YAML is checked with yamllint. Both run as a
**Lint** job in CI on every push and PR.

```bash
pip install ruff yamllint

ruff check .          # lint
ruff format .         # format (Black-compatible)
yamllint .            # YAML
```

Config lives in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) and [`.yamllint.yaml`](.yamllint.yaml).

### Running the red team

Comment `/redteam` on any PR to kick off the full prompt injection security suite against
that branch. See [`tests/redteam/README.md`](tests/redteam/README.md) for local setup and
what each test covers.
